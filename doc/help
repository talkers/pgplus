 &t Online Help

   The easiest way to use HELP is to start with HELP INDEX and then go
   through all the pages - HELP 1, HELP 2, etc ...

   Help can also be found on various commands and specific topics. Simply
   type "HELP <command or topic>" for information. Alternatively you can
   enter any command followed by "/?" or "-h" (ie. "PINFO -H") and the
   relevant help will be shown.

   If you think you've found an error or a missing help file then please
   let the admin know by sending email to &e.

   Original help files written by traP, astyanax and Indiefan. Additional
   files, updates and presentation changes by Silver and enigma.

:14,|,pipe 

         A way of directing text to several different people.

          Format: <emote/shout/say/echo> <msg> | <user list>
            (see 'help ulist' for help on <user list>)

        Example     emote smiles at you. | alice,astyanax

        You will see : 
                You emote : &m->n smiles at alice and astyanax.

        alice sees (as a personal message)
                &m->n smiles at you and astyanax.

        astyanax sees (as a personal message)
                &m->n smiles at alice and you.

        Everyone else in the room sees (as a room message) :
                &m->n smiles at alice and astyanax.

:15,chan,channel

The original Playground channel code has been scrapped for a more pleasant
and easier to use format. There are 3 available channels for you to speak
on:

Main Channel (requirements: resident)        - See "help mainchannel"

Spod Channel (requirements: spod)            - See "help spodchannel"

Z Channel (requirements: resident)           - See "help zchannel"

Dynamic saved channels (requirements: none)  - See "help dsc"

:16,color,syscolor,colorize,fingerpaint,colour,syscolour,colourize

We now offer color! 

To use this, you should be on a terminal that supports ANSI color codes. 
More help on getting color to work may be made available later.

But for now, try it by typing FINGERPAINT.

If you see colors, then you will be able to use and view colors. Even if some
colors don't seem to work, others may, and you may want to activate it, even 
if its only for a few shades.

Color related commands:

COLOR 	- activate standard color mode -- you will see the colors others
	  create in their rooms, in help files, in descriptions, practically
	  everywhere.

SYSCOLOR - This enables Active Color Mode -- where you can set the colors
	   of certain types of input by using the COLORIZE command. So your
	   tells can be white while your shouts are dark blue and your 
	   friend tells scream in blinking text.

COLORIZE - Without an argument, it will show you your current system colors.
	   With arguments, it will change your color settings for one type of
	   command.

Good luck, and any questions should be relayed to &e.

:17,aliases,define,undefine,lsa,alias

We now supports aliases. An alias is a substitute for a longer  
set of commands.. for example...

  define idin idle indiefan        (you can also use "alias")

This creates a "pseudo-command" called idin. If i type idin, I will see how 
long indiefan has been idle.

  PG ->idin
  indieFan has just hit return.
  PG ->

You can also list your aliases.

  PG ->lsa
-------------- You are using 1 of your maximum 10 aliases -----------------
idin                 = idle indiefan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PG ->

Also, it is easy to remove an alias you no longer need.

  PG ->undefine idin
  Alias deleted...
  PG ->lsa
  You are not using any of your 10 aliases.
  PG ->

See help advanced for more info on what can be done with aliases.

:3,describe

These commands are to spice up your examine (x) file and finger (f) 
file.  Some of them are for both files, some are for only one.  They have 
been separated for your convenience.

-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-

For BOTH files:
---------------

age: 

	To set your age, type:  age <number>
	You must set the age to a numerical value.  It will not recognize
	anything else.  Typing 'age 0' turns this function off.

birthday (bday):

	To set your birthday, type:  bday <month/date>
	If you want your birthday to be set to Feb 29, you _must_ include
	the year in the date.  For example: bday 2/29/96.  The only time
	you do not have to include the year, is when it is an actual leap
	year.  Typing 'bday 0' turns this function off.

description (desc):

	To set up a description of yourself, type:  desc <self depiction>

hometown:

	To set the location of where you are, type:  hometown <place>

madefrom (formerly automatically set based on gender):

	To set what you are made from, type:  madefrom <components>
	You may now set this to whatever you wish it to be.  If you
	type madefrom without anything after it, it will default to
	the old message.

title:

	To set your own title type:  title <insert your noble rank here>
	You do not need to put your name at the beginning of your title.
	The program will do it for you automatically.  If you prefer to
	have just your name, and no title after it, type title with no
	message after it.  (i.e. just type: title)

toggle:

	To set your email and/or site public for friends or everyone to see,
	type:  toggle <email or site> <friends or everyone>
	If you do not toggle your email or site, it is assumed that
	you wish for them to remain private.

url (WWW homepage location):

	To set the location of your homepage, type:  url <location>
	This is NOT to set up a homepage.  It is only for those who
	currently have one.

-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-

For the Examine (x) File _only_:
--------------------------------

favorite:

	To set up a favorite, type:  favorite # <item> <thing>
	* The number must be 1, 2, or 3, as you are only allowed 3 
	  favorites.
	* The item may be no longer than 12 characters long.
	* For example: to show that your favorite movie is Star Wars
	  type: favorite 1 movie Star Wars
	* To delete a favorite, type:  favorite #

	Make sure that you have the correct # of the one you wish to remove.
	Also, you do not put in an <item> or <thing> when you are deleting
	a favorite.

irl_name:

	To set the name you go by in real life, type:  irl_name <your name>

-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-

For the Finger (f) File _only_:
-------------------------------

plan:
	To set your plan, type:  plan <what you want to do with your life>
	If you wish to remove the plan section from your f-file,
	type plan with no comments after it.  (i.e. just type:  plan)

*Note: The examine (x) file is for people to get more info on you when 
you are currently logged in.  The finger (f) file is to get more info 
when you are not currently logged in.

-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-,._.,-*~'``'~*-

Miscellaneous Personalization Commands
(these don't affect the x or f files):
--------------------------------------

prefix:

	To set a prefix, type:  prefix <msg>
	This has a limit of 16 characters, and will not accept any blank
	spaces within it.  The prefix is also shown to anyone who has the

:ads,advert,advertise,advertising

Advertising other talkers here:

	*Don't*

	These are examples of "acceptable" advertising here:
		* Ask an admin to list you on help 'talkers'.
		* Do a friend tell.
		
	Everything else is not appreciated, and will be handled severely. This
	is because we are a new talker ourselves, and don't appreciate being
	"raided" by other talkers.

Advertising our talker on other talkers:
	
	* Do tell your friends about this place.
	* Do ask to have us listed in a help talkers 

	* Don't shout addresses. Its rude.
	* Don't post news without explicit admin permission.

Advertising our talker elsewhere on the Internet:

	* Newsgroups: Try and stick to "appropriate" groups
	* WWW: Try and get us listed on WWW pages that link
	  to talkers

		(if you want to link it to your home page, do this:)
	 	<A HREF = "telnet://site.com:port/"> Link to &t </A>	

	* Email:  Mail your friends, not random people ;)
	* Other:  Your own best judgment, based on these guidelines.

:advanced,%

These "variables" can be inserted into an alias you create.

%0          - This means to list all arguments and insert here.

e.g.        define sillysay emote sez -=> %0 <=-
	    sillysay red doofus
	    sillysay bouncey bouncey bouncey :-P
	    sillysay .

%1  %2      - These mean to take this word in the list of arguments.

e.g.        define bop remote %1 bops you with a %2
	    bop traP spoon 
	    (you bop traP with a spoon)

            define flip emote tackles %2 and %1.
	    flip traP Nogard   
	    (you tackle Nogard and trap)

%-1   %-2   This is a special case. You can list all arguments AFTER the first,
		second, etc, word.

	    define tickle remote %1 tickles you all until %-1.
	    tickle friends the end of the day.
	    (you tickle your friends until the end of the day)
	    
            define telltwo tell %1,%2 %-2
	    telltwo traP Nogard hello silly coders.
	    (you tell traP and Nogard 'hello silly coders')

%;	    This is a very special case. This can be used to perform multiple
	    commands with one alias. The %; separates the commands from each 
	    other.

	    define getinfo x me%;lsu%;swho%;qwho

	    When you type getinfo, you will x yourself, do an lsu, a swho, and 
	      a qwho in that order.

%{@@}	    This is the most recent addition. You can insert random phrases
		into your aliases.. Pay careful attention to the format.

	    define cast_spell emote chants as %{red@green@blue} smoke swirls.

		This will choose a random word (red, green, or blue) and use
		that in the phrase.

	    This is not allowed.

		define random_arg say %{1@2@3}
		You would randomly say the numbers rather than using that word.

	    However, this may change in the future.

	
One word of warning. If you abuse aliases they will be removed from you.

If an alias you write crashes the program, don't use the alias again. Also, 
	report it to the admins so they can fix the bug.

And, be careful about doing stuff like this...

	define oy say oy %1, that hurt.

	PG ->oy

	Funny things may happen when you forget an argument..

:aecho

AECHO <arg>  - sends a completely anonymous echo to everyone.

(10 commands, and you won't look like a total moron.. but you should learn
the others too, if you want to be a REAL user of the talker!)

:bedit

BEDIT  - Enter the banished sites editor.

Note: This is a pain to use and it is recommended that you edit this file
      from within the talker account. However it is handy to undo a
      banish.

	       BDAY  06/15 sets your birthday to June 15, doesn't touch age.

-=> yes, BDAY is an alias of BIRTHDAY in the never ending quest for shorter
    commands =)

*Known bug: If you want to set a BDAY of 2/29, you must use the year
 as well to make it work. There is no fix to this bug yet, sorry.

                                    what they say, shout, etc.

:builder_rules,brules,b_rules,b.rules,b-rules

Rules for Builders
------------------

1.   No creation of offensive items.

2.   No creation of alcoholic beverages.
	
3.   No creation of items that break any rules.

4.   No intentional creation of an item that shares the name of
     another user with the intention of using it to harass.

5.   No creation of items that already exist.

6.   No exploiting system or item bugs.

If you abuse the ability to create items, builder status will be revoked.

:bump

BUMP <player>   - Bumps a player silently off the talker.

You can also type 'BUMP NEWBIES' to automatically remove all newbies from
the program (useful for several newbies from the same site who are all
causing problems).

There is no message to the player(s) - they just suddenly disappear.

:buy

BUY <object>  - Buys an item from the LSO list.

Note: * You can only buy the item provided you have enough money for it.
      * To gain more money - log on more!

:ch_hi

CH_HI		- toggle highlighting of channels on/off

:change_command_privs

CHANGE_COMMAND_PRIVS <command> <priv level>  - Changes a commands priv
                                               level to a new one.

Note: * The new command levels are NOT saved by the program. When you
        reboot they will be back to the original settings.
      * Don't do silly things such as change the level of "quit", 
        "shutdown" or even this command :o)
      * This is ideal if a command is causing problems with the talker,
        you can make it inaccessible to a majority of people so as to
        prevent the code crashing again.

:chlim

CHLIM <limit type> <player> <new limit>  - change player limits.

Note: * Limits that can be changed are: mail, list, room, auto, exit,
        alias, item

:ckban

CKBAN <IP address>  - Check if a site is banned, and why, and to what
                      extent.

Here are some examples of its use..

->ckban 0.0.0.0
Site is totally banned.
Banned by: &m->n
Reason: # Constant harassment of other users.
->ckban 255.255.255.0
Site is banned to new users.
Banned by: &m->n
Reason: # people keep shouting addresses to other talkers
->ckban 128.58.99.69
That site doesn't appear to be banned.....

NOTES:
1) You can't use * wild-cards
2) If a site is banned twice, only the first listing will show up.
3) You can't scan name addresses.. i.e. ckban pgplus.whiting.co.uk
   This is because all bans are stored internally as IP's.

:clist

       on any MUD client (since they suppressed escape codes).

DELETE <item>                          - Delete an item.

Note: * When deleting an item all occurrences of it will disappear. All
        those players who have bought that item will be given a full
        refund.
      * Type HELP BITS for the possible arguments to SETBIT.

:creation

So you want to create an item... first you have to be a builder.

If you are then decide what you want to build. Lets say, I decide to
create a can of spam.  Since spam can (technically) be eaten, I'll make it
a food item.  Also, since spam is such a part of Internet culture, I'll
make it cheap.

I type (in this order)

	create Spam A can of rubbery mystery meat

	setbit spam food

	setval spam 25

This makes spam, at a cost of 25 pennies, available as an edible item.

Note: * If spam already exists, then it will fail to create spam.
      * After you SETVAL an item, you can no longer edit it, so 
	make sure your SETBIT stuff is done FIRST.
      * Item names and descriptions cannot be too long
      * Item names cannot start with $, -, +, or a number

:decap

DECAP <user>  - removes / grants the ability to use upper case letters.

:deflogon,deflogoff,defrecon,logon,logoff,recon

These are special aliases you can define for what happens just before you 
logon, reconnect, or logoff -- do NOT give these aliases arguments, because 
they will not be sent any arguments by the program.

DEFLOGON <string>   - change the script before you logon
DEFLOGOFF <string>  - change the script after you logoff
DEFRECON <string>   - change the script after a reconnection.

:desc,description

DESC <msg>  - sets a little description of yourself =)

-=> DESC is aliased to DESCRIPTION - some people LIKE the longer commands =)

:dibbs,call

DIBBS <player> - Call "dibbs" on a player.   Used on newbies that are 
		 experienced users and you don't wish to  spam with the
		 obligatory "assist" message.   Only su's see the "call".

                          them to type 'quit')

:drugs,drug,pot,marijuana,cocaine,heroin,alcohol,illegal

A DRUG is defined, for the purpose of the talker rules,
as ANY substance that is illegal to either make, use, buy, sell, or
possess in the United States of America, without the specific prescription
of a Doctor of Medicine.  This includes substances such as cocaine, 
marijuana, heroin, PCP, LSD, as well as many others.  Discussion of 
these items, even mentioning them, in any tell, say, shout, sing, mail, 
news, or any other sort of communication at all is completely illegal 
on the talker.  The continued existence of the talker comes 
before your "right" to free speech.

The following are technically drugs, but are not illegal to 
discuss, because their possession, use, purchase and selling are not
illegal: caffeine, nicotine, aspirin, etc.

Alcohol and any alcohol containing substances are in a special
intermediate category. Discussion, mentioning of them, etc, is LEGAL,
however EXCESSIVE discussion of alcohol will not be tolerated. The
decision as to what is and is not "excessive" is up to the individual
superuser.

These rules exist so that the talker can continue to exist
in the face of the drug paranoia that prevails in most of America.
Sorry, but thats just the way it is. As I said before, the continued 
existence of the talker comes before anything else.

:dsc,join_chan,leave_chan,lsc,list_chans,dsc_hi

Dynamic saved channels are an extremely simple way of being on more than
one channel at the same time whilst reducing the number of additional
commands you need to know.

JOIN_CHAN <name>  - Join a channel. If it doesn't exist then it will be
                    created automatically. Channel names must not be the
                    name of a current resident and contain only standard
                    letters.

LEAVE_CHAN <name>  - Leave the channel.

LSC / LIST_CHANS  - List the channels you are on.

DSC_HI  - Hi-light all dynamic saved channels

To talk on the channels use your normal remote commands (ie. tell,
rthink, rsing, remote). Should you quit the talker without disconnecting
from that channel then you will be automatically reconnected to it upon
login.

For an example see "help dsc-example"

:dsc-example

join_chan silver
 You don't really want to name your channel after a person... do you?
join_chan test
 No match of the name 'test' found in files.

:dumb

Note: * They won't be able to talk, emote, or anything (correctly) for as
        long as they are dumbed.

        still be acting silly!

:dump

DUMP  - dump all notes to disk

:earmuffs

EARMUFFS  - block all shouts 

:eat

EAT <item>  - Eats an item that you have in your inventory.

      * Once an item is eaten it is gone, and you do not get a refund for
        the cost of the item.

:echo,+

ECHO <message>  - sends a "semi-anonymous" message to everyone in the
                  room.

+Boo!     You echo: Boo!   + Boo!               + [&m->n] Boo!
echo hi.  You echo: hi.    + hi.                + [&m->n] hi.

 not is controlled by the 'show' command).

:edfirst

EDFIRST <player> [-] <time in days>  - edit the time of a person's first

:edtime

EDTIME <player> [-] <hours>  - edit someone's login time.

Note: * If you don't use this command carefully you can really screw up
        both their login time and spod factor!

:ef,rf,pf,rtf,sf,ft,yf

These are the "friends channel" commands. They send private messages to anyone
who is logged on, and is on YOUR list as a friend.

:emote,;,:

EMOTE <action>  - this is the most "general" type of communication. It
                  simply puts whatever you say after your name with no
                  "extras" added on and sends it to everyone in the same
                  room as you.

eg:  emote giggles            &m->n giggles
     emote blinks at you.     &m->n blinks at you.

Note: * EMOTE is aliased to : and ;
      * If your "action" begins with a ' symbol, the program assumes you

   everyone but trap sees:

&m->n says to everyone but trap 'hey everyone! it's trap's 
    birthday! Shhhhh...'

   trap sees:

:exitmsg

FAVORITE <#> BLANK             - delete a favorite

(in examine file)
Favorite cereal       : cheerios.

  realize this yet)

FRIEND <player(s)> on/off/[blank]  - you declare the player(s) to be your
                                     friends. They will begin to receive
                                     your 'friend tells'

gags work just like ignores, except that they don't take up a spot on
your list.. the price for this, however, is when you (or they) quit the
program, they get ungagged, because gags aren't saved.  However, gags are
useful to protect yourself against harassment from newbies, and if you are
a newbie, from harassment in general.

They also tend to send a message of "geez, chill out" -- people generally
don't like to be gagged, and may take the hint when a few people gag them.

Hacking is defined on the talker as anyone who tries to login as 
someone else. You may have one, and ONLY one, saved resident character
on the talker. You cannot "borrow" someone else's account, with, or without
their consent.

Any person who attempts to hack the talker, whether the actual account
or any residents account, will be COMPLETELY site banned - meaning that 
no one from your domain (for most of you, this means your entire school
or your entire service provider) will ever be allowed to logon to the
talker again. In addition, if we know what account you used to hack
from, we WILL report this information to your system administrator, and
ask that your Internet accounts be permanently removed.

Simply put, we will not tolerate illegal access attempts, and we will take
any and all actions that we can to stop them from occurring.

See also: help icq_more

:icq_more

Here is a brief description of what ICQ is and what it is capable of doing...

ICQ is a program that allows you to communicate with your list of friends
w/out ever having to login on a network. In short, it works as a talker
outside of a talker. When you register with ICQ, you will receive a UIN
(universal identification number) which acts as your phone number. This
allows you to do the following: you may send a message to a person on
your list, chat with them, send them information on an URL, send a file,
email them, and play Internet based games. Loosely stated, this program
allows you to do almost all the commands that you are accustomed to w/out
having to login on a system, except the ICQ system.

By downloading ICQ from www.mirabilis.com you will be able to conduct
real time chats and send addresses of web-pages to your friends. This
program is very flexible and currently many add-ons are being made, thus
this program will only get bigger and better.

Once you have downloaded ICQ, please be sure to place your UIN in the ICQ
slot of your examine file. This will allow fellow spods to place you on
their list.

If you have any concerns or questions, please contact one of the
staff members (type 'help staff' for a list).

:idlemsg

IDLEMSG <msg> - set a short message saying why you're idle..

:idling,truespod

From now on, when you idle for a sufficient amount of time, the program
will catch this, and will deduct time from your total login time. This means
that, now, everyone has two "total login" amounts.. total login (which includes
idling) and truespod, which penalizes idlers, and is therefore a more
accurate measurement of how big a spod you are.

Also, a friendly warning: people who get kicked off by the program for idling
for an hour -- you may notice your adjusted spod time plummet...

:ignore

IGNORE <player(s)> on/off/[blank]  - you don't see what the ignored
                                     player(s) says or does/do.

:ignoremsg

IGNOREMSG <message> - Set what your message will be to people to try to
                      talk to you when you are ignoring them.

Example:

  ignoremsg doesn't want to talk to you  -- Set your ignoremsg
  ignore deathboy                        -- Ignore DeathBoy

                                     person if they are on.

Example: Say there are two people on "Silver" and "SillyGirl" and you'd
         rather talk to "SillyGirl" then you can type:

           prefer sillygirl

         From then on all tells to "S", "Si" or "Sil" will go, by default,
         to "SillyGirl". If you have two or more people preferred then you
         will get a "multiple matches" error and when "SillyGirl" logs out
         tells will go to "Silver".
         
:prefix

PREFIX <pretitle>  - sets the title before your name.

If you are net.engaged, it will appear on your X

:prs,game,games

You can play paper-rock-scissors against a friend.

PRS <player> <paper|rock|scissors>  - Play PRS against a player and
                                      choosing the item you want.

If they have not already challenged you then they will get the message:

  &m->n wants to play paper-rock-scissors against you

otherwise you will be informed of who has one.


Note: * You can only play against one person at a time.
      * Paper beats Rock, Rock beats Scissors, scissors beats paper.
      * If you get errors saying that you're "not playing against that

:public,toggle

TOGGLE EMAIL <friend/public/private>  - Toggle your email address to be
                                        viewable only by friends, viewable
                                        by the public, or hidden from
                                        everyone.

TOGGLE SITE <friend/public/private>  - Toggle your site, just like your

                                       time.

        (incorrectly) report that everyone is very lagged. After 10
        seconds it will be fine.
      * It is NOT recommended to force the anti-crash code to do a
        seamless reboot since this may not fix the problem and make your
        talker stay in a reboot/crash loop.
      * Up-times and longest spodding times are not affected.

eg: recap traP

:ressie,residency

One of the more common questions we get is "What does it mean to be a 
resident?" There are many advantages to gaining residency, among them :
   
* You don't have to go through all those annoying validation procedures
  every time you enter the program.

* You get to have your own list, and with that comes friends lists,
  informs (notify you when someone connects to the program) and the like.

* And most importantly, you get a room of your own!!  You can make your 
  own description for it and have all your friends over for a chat (and
  keep annoying gits out of it as well).

Gaining residency is simple.  Just look around for the friendly 
neighborhood SU (or type lsu if you don't see any in the room you're in) 
and tell <su's name> you would like to become a resident.  Generally 
there are two requirements : 1. A valid email address and 2. Agreement to 
follow help rules (type help rules to see them).  Thats all there is to 
it :)  Enjoy your newfound residency :)

=astyanax (4/6/95)

:ressies

RESSIES [on/off]  - toggle whether or not to allow non-staff members to

:restore

RESTORE <letter of alphabet>  - restore a group of player files
                                (leave this alone!)

:rlist

RLIST <player list> <flag list>  - Resets a list toggle... in other words,
                                   always turns off.

Example:

  rlist trap inform

If you have trap on your list as inform, this erases that flag.

:rm_list

RM_LIST <player>  - Remove your name from someone's list.

Note: * It only removes "good" entries like friend, not "bad" entries like 
        bar or ignore and it doesn't tell the other player what you've
        done.

:rm_move

RM_MOVE <player> <minutes>  - Stops a person moving for an amount of time

Note: * Setting <minutes> to -1 will prevent them moving perminantly

:rm_sing,rm_shout

RM_SHOUT <player> <time>  } a few minutes.

If the <time> is set to 0 then it will allow them to sing or shout again.

(Using 0 or -1 will work on players not logged in at the time)

:robots

Robots are computer controlled residents of this talker. You can treat
them exactly the same as normal residents (ie. add them on your list, bar
them, use socials on them) but you won't get a conversation out of them.

If you'd like to see the robots do more then please let the admin know of
your ideas.

:room_edit,room-edit,rooms_edit,rooms-edit

Decorating your room
--------------------

Firstly you need to decide the name of your room. This is the description
that people see when they type WHERE. Don't forget to include the word
"in" otherwise people will see "&m->n is the forest" rather than
"&m->n is in the forest".

ROOM NAME <title>  - Set the name of your room.

You also need to give your room an id. This is a unique name and is of the
format "<owner>.<name>". All rooms have this id and whilst you can have
the default it is better to change it.

ROOM ID <name>  - Set the id of your room. You only need to type in the
                  latter part. For the example above we'd use "ROOM ID
                  FOREST".

You now need to set an enter message, this is the message that people will
see when someone goes to your room.

ROOM ENTERMSG <message>  - Set the room enter message. An example would be
                           "ROOM ENTERMSG ENTERS THE FOREST" which will
                           show "<name> enters the forest" when they go to
                           your room.

Decorating (editing) your room:
------------------------------

Step 1: Getting into the editor to decorate your room.
 	-type: room edit
	-If this is done correctly, you will see the description of your
	 room show up as:
		A bare room belonging to (your name).
		Isn't it time to write a description?


Step 2A: Deleting the entire room description with one command.
	-If you want to just delete the entire room that you currently have,
	 type: .wipe (making sure the period is in there.)
		-This is only if you want to start from scratch.  You will
 		 lose everything that you currently have!  This can be used
		 at any time. (If yo do this you can skip step 2B)

Step 2B: Deleting the description already there.
	-Part A: You need to move back two lines within the editor.
		-type: .- (make sure you put the period in there, or it
		 will be assumed that the - is part of your room design)
		-Do this two times.  Each time you move back a line
		 the editor will show you what line you have moved
		 to.

	-Part B: Now, you need to delete the line.
		-type: .del (again, make sure the period is in there.)
			-This will delete the line that you are currently on.
			-The editor will not show you what line gets deleted
			 however, so make sure you know exactly where you are.
			-To make sure you know where you are, play with the
			 .- and .+ functions.  (.+ will move you forward one
			 line.)

	-Parts A and B are also ways of making any corrections to a specific
	 line in your description.

Step 3: Designing your room.
	-Type whatever you want your description or design to be at the +
	 (prompt).
	-After you hit return, the line you have just typed will appear again.
	-Please be aware, if you are doing a design, that the prompt does not
	 take up an actual space in the design.  (You will learn what I mean
	 when you hit return, as everything will be shifted over one space.)
	-This editor is a line by line editor.
		-This means that you need to hit return when you get to the
	 	 end of a line (80 characters) in order to make sure that it  
		 turns out the way you want it to.  The editor will continue 
		 each line if you do not hit return, and the design or 
		 description may not turn out the way you had planned.
	-One tip, especially for those doing designs, is to draw what you want
	 on graph paper.  This will help you with your spacing.

Step 4: Saving your room.
	-type: .end (Make sure that the period is in there.)
		-This will QUIT out of the editor, and SAVE all changes that
		 have been made by you.

Notes and Tips:
	-Quitting Without Saving
		-If you are unsatisfied with the room you've created, and
		 DON'T want to save the changes (and don't want to work on
		 your room anymore due to frustration):
			-type: .quit (Make sure the period is in there.)

	-If you are using Tiny Fugue:
		-Leave a space between the prompt (+) and slash (/), if that
		 is the first character in the line.
		-Also, be aware that the above means that you will have to
		 shift the entire design over one space.  Not just the line
		 with a slash at the beginning.

indieFan (7 Feb, 1996)

:rsing,(

RSING       - sends a SING to a specific list of people.

-=> RSING is aliased to (

Format: rsing <player(s)> <message>

(astyanax yeah yeah yeah        &m->n sings to you o/~ yeah yeah yeah o/~

:rt,*,rthink

RT <player(s)> (thought>  - short for 'REMOTE THINK' - it's just like
                            think, except it goes to a specific list of
                            people instead of the room that you're in.

-=> RT is aliased to *

*trap huh?          &m->n thinks . o O ( huh? )      (only trap sees it)

:rules

This is a set of guidelines of expected behavior on the program.

  1. No drug discussion.

  2. No harassment. Don't be abusive. If you're abusive to someone,
     don't expect the SU's to give you any slack. (see HELP HARASS)

  3. Attacking people's personal beliefs on controversial issues such as
     abortion, religion, etc, is against the rules.

  4. The decision on what is and is not "harassment" is up to the 
     individual superuser. If they tell you to knock it off, knock it
     off!

  5. Speaking of language - the official language of this talker is
     English. Feel free to speak whatever you want in private 
     rooms. However, in the public discussions, we ask that you
     speak English.

  6. Most people find all words typed in all CAPITAL letters annoying.
     For this reason, we ask that you keep capitalizations to a
     minimum. Realize that the program scans for capital letters
     and "symbols" in shouts, and automatically limits your ability
     to shout - so it's in your best interest to keep the caps to a
     minimum as well. Also note that excessive use of colors in shouts can
     result in having shouting privileges removed too.

  7. No multiple characters - if we see that you have a multiple
     character, all characters will be nuked (deleted) with no notice.

  8. The job of interpreting these rules is that of the superuser.
     Therefore, the decisions of a superuser in interpreting these rules
     is beyond argument.

For more, read HELP HARASS, ADS, HACK, SPAM, M-RULES, B-RULES and C-RULES

:save

SAVE  - Save your character. The code automatically tries to save you when
        you quit if you are a resident and periodically saves your file
        whilst you are on the talker.

:say,',",`

SAY <something>  - Tells everyone in the same room as you something.

if <something> ends with a ! then it becomes an "exclaim"
if it ends in ? then it becomes an "ask"
if it ends in anything else, it's a "say"

eg:   say hi people!            &m->n exclaims 'hi people!'
      say where are you from?   &m->n asks 'where are you from?'
      say that's cool.          &m->n says 'that's cool.'

Note: * SAY is also aliased to " ' `

:spod-classes,spod.classes,spod_classes,spodclasses,spodclass

-> How many pests would a pestispod pest if a pestispod could spod pests? <-

There are 15 basic subdivisions of the Spod class: These include -

Antispod        - A spod who enjoys tricking and hurting newbies. These
                  spods are very dangerous to newbies.
Minispod        - These spods often sit idle for minutes and hours at a
                  time, often because they are also multispods.
Multispod       - Spods who can and do multi-task so they can log on to
                  several talkers and muds simultaneously
Superspod       - Spods who are also superusers (or equivalent)
Pestispod       - Spods who always ask "Can I be an SU?" As this class is
                  very large and diverse, the pestispod has several
                  classical subdivisions of it's own.
Grabypestispod  - Spods who try to become an su by making a big deal
                  about bringing new people into the talker.
Helpypestispod  - Spods who make a big deal about helping newbies (some
                  will only be "helpful" if an admin is in the room!)
Assitipestispod - Spod who makes a big deal about helping the admin
                  (giving ideas, volunteering to make system rooms, etc.)
Megaspod        - Spods who outspod spods :) To be a true megaspod is the
                  ultimate complement, and the ultimate insult :)
Hermospod       - Hermospods spend an inordinate amount of time (over 70%)
                  of their time in their own home room.
Publispod       - Publispods spend 70% or more of their time in public
                  (usually the main) rooms
Scitzospod      - Special class of spods. Scitzospods usually have
                  multiple characters (usually on different talkers... see
                  help rules if you're thinking about using different
                  names on the same talker)
Spatulaspod     - (derived from the 'your.name' is you, you spoon!
                  message). Spatulaspods are either absent-minded, or just
                  stooopid.
Transvispod     - These are the crossgender spods : male pretending to be
                  female and vice versa is not the only form, this can be
                  used in jest with people who set their genders to plural
                  or "it"
Vampispod       - Spods who prefer to do their spodding when the sun is
                  down.
Solarspod       - Spods who do their spodding during daylight hours.
Adminospod      - All admins are spods. If they weren't they wouldn't set
                  up a talker, would they? :-)
Anonyispod      - A spod who is a member of Spodders Anonymous.

Most spods belong to more than one of these classes: for example

Someone exclaims 'Trap, you lousy MegaMultiSuperPubliVampiSpatulaspod!'

       * If you give no arguments then details will centred on you

(see "help spod" for a definition)

:staff

STAFF  - Lists all the staff and admin on the talker.

:statcommands

STATCOMMANDS  - Provides some stats about commands being used
                (does not include SU or ADMIN commands)

:su,super,superuser

One of the most frequently asked questions here is 'how can I become an
su?' Because of this, this help file has been created to answer this
question.

First off, the candidate must realize what the su position entails
(this does not mean that you must be an su elsewhere to become an su
here, but rather that you learn what it means to be an su before you
are actually granted the su privileges/responsibilities)

Being an SU does NOT mean that you can just sneeze, boot and frog at will
The admins here take these things very seriously. Such commands are to be
used only as a last resort for dealing with those who would cause chaos and
anarchy here. It is MUCH better, both for the su, and for the player, to
be able to resolve an issue without having to resort to the threat or use
of the su commands. People who are able to "explain" that 'such behavior
is frowned upon, and should not be continued' are much preferred to the 
people whose automatic answer to any situation is to boot or sneeze.

Being an SU means, quite frankly, that you have to put up with whatever
others on the talker dish out. This ranges from the Admins and their        
quirks and insanity (all admins are insane. Don't let anyone tell you
differently) to residents who hate your guts because of jealousy of your
position, to newbies asking the silliest questions imaginable, like "how
do i talk?" and "what is a title?"      

As an SU, part of your job is teacher. Everyone on the program will come to
you first with any questions they have, from simple commands like seeecho   
and earmuffs, to complex commands (like the dreaded room edit commands) to
non-talker related questions (like 'how do I FTP' or 'how do I finger a
site' or even 'what is the command to compile a program in c++?')

Note that, while you are expected to handle the simple and complex talker
commands, a knowledge of the non-talker related stuff, while helpful, will
not affect your chances of getting a position as an su here. But, you 
should know who on the talker (staff or otherwise) CAN answer such 
questions, and be able to direct the questions you cannot answer to the
appropriate person. 

You should be familiar with all the resident commands, and be able to 
explain the quickly and clearly to others. You can't let frustration
show when a newbie says 'i don't get it' or 'that's not what i meant.'
I can guarantee from experience that you'll have people who simply have
no business using a computer, who somehow stumble on the 'telnet' command,
asking you questions and then never understanding the answer. You just have
to wear a fake smile and try again.

You'll have to deal with people who are just really stupid, who all they
want to do is cause troubles for everyone else, and especially you. People
will hate your guts, and you'll just have to deal with it with your
therapist (you DO have a therapist, don't you?)

You'll have to be an example to the other users, never bending the rules
yourself, and remember that, as long as you are a su here, you represent
the entire talker with every action you take. 

However... if you think you can handle it, then that's great. Here's some
advice on how to become one, from someone who's been there. Never harass the 
admins .. they have to deal with this 'can i be an su' question more times 
in the day than they can count, and the last thing they wanna hear is another
variation of that question. Try never to break the rules. Be friendly to 
other users, su's and newbies alike. (being a friendly person is a big plus)
Always be helpful. But don't stress too much about being helpful... you'll
just look like a kiss-up.

If you REALLY REALLY have an interest in being an su here, however, then
we suggest you send an email to the admin telling them why you'd think
you'd make a good su here.

something more acceptable.

Some commands will only be filtered if you are in the main room (eg.
"say", "emote", "think" and "sing") others will always be filtered (eg.
"shout" and all channels).

Just because we replace these words doesn't mean you can still use them.
If you continually swear expect to have a Superuser dealing with you.

                              the message.

:ulist

A <user list> is a list of users.  The list can be made up of
anyone you wish, and can be used in a variety of situations.

For example, let's say you want to tell Joe and Bob the same
thing.  You *could* tell them both separately:

	tell Joe Meet me for lunch at noon
	tell Bob Meet me for lunch at noon

But wouldn't it be much easier to tell them both with one
command?  Ahh, the beauty of user lists. :)  The following
command can accomplish this task:

	tell Joe,Bob Meet me for lunch at noon

You can see from this example that a user list is simply a
group of users' names, separated by a comma (,) .  You can also
use the user list to emote to more than one person in a room:

	emote grins at you. | joe,bob

Bob sees:
	&m->n grins at you and Joe.
Joe sees:
	&m->n grins at you and Bob.

Neat, eh? :)

any rules, and it must be smaller than 20 lines (the 20 line limit may be
negotiable under special circumstances)

:wield

WIELD <item>  - Wield a "weapon" in your inventory.

The use for this is to check if a newbie wants to ressie a name that
might be too similar to a name already taken by someone else.

99 times out of 100, they will pick a new name and you can rename them
and ressie them then.

Once you become a builder you should read "help create"

<<ADMINS NEED TO INSERT THEIR POLICY ON GIVING OUT THIS PRIV HERE>>

For more about creating a social see "help social-create"

:social-create

To start the creation of a social:

CREATE_SOCIAL <command for it> <type>

Where <type> can be either "simple", "complex" or "private".

* Simple socials are messages which go to rooms only. They cannot be
    directed at anyone and only the people in the same room as the sender
    will see the message.

* Complex socials can go to rooms but can also be directed at people. If
    it is directed at a person and the sender and receiver are in the
    same room then everyone else in the room sees a message.

* Private socials are just that. Only you and the person you send the
    social to get any messages.

You can add the following strings in which will be replaced when the

%himher      - The social executors gender (in form "him", "her" or it")
%heshe       - The social executors gender (in form "he", "she" or "it")
%fullname    - The social executors full name (with prefix)
%name        - The social executors name (without prefix)

%t_hisher    - The social targets gender (in form "his", "her" or "its")
%t_himher    - The social targets gender (in form "him", "her" or it")
%t_heshe     - The social targets gender (in form "he", "she" or "it")
%t_fullname  - The social targets full name (with prefix)
%t_name      - The social targets name (without prefix)

%str         - The input string

You can also have random words or phrases incorporated in your socials
like so:

{option1|option2|option3|option4}

You can have as any options as you like and when parses only one of these
options will be shown. An example could be:

setsoc room_msg {runs|skips|hops|leaps} over to %t_name and
{hits|throws|punches} %himher in the {face|teeth|eyes|head}.

Note, you do Not need a % in front of the opening brace {
and putting one there will only get interpreted as a literal %
  (meaning, itll put a % there as normal)

Don't forget you can also incorporate dynatext for some really impressive
socials!

:dynatext,twinkle,twinkles

&t supports dynatext, a simple yet clever system which allows
you to tailor your messages, descriptions etc. depending upon the person
reading it.

It is based around the same concept of color but with the & character.

Nearly all dynatext is prefixed with either:

  &&c->               - Refers to the current player
  &&m->               - Refers to the player seeing the message
  &&r->               - Refers to a random player in the room
  &&a->               - Refers to a random player on &t

Afterwards you can append any of the additional characters:

  n    - Person's name
  f    - Person's full local time and date
  h    - Current hours
  m    - Current minutes
  s    - Current seconds
  w    - Day of the week
  o    - Month name
  d    - Date
  r    - Rank
  c    - Cash
  g    - Gender in the possessive form - his/her/its
  G    - Gender in the form - he/she/it
  i    - Gender in the form - him/her/it
  p    - Partner (engaged or married)
  l    - The time lagged, in seconds
  L    - Textual description of lag time, as shown in 'x'

If you don't add a an arrow and a letter to the end then it will assume
you want '->n' (the name)

And these don't require a prefix at all:

  &&t   - The name of the talker
  &&T   - The address and port of the talker
  &&e   - The email address of the admins
  &&j   - The current slots jackpot

If you wish to ignore dynatext then use the MUFFLE command. If you wish to
see all dynatext but know that it is dynatext then you can use the "SHOW
DYNATEXT" command.

For examples please see "help dynatext-examples"

:dynatext-examples

To get the current time of the person reading it you would use:

  &&m->h:&&m->m

To get the current time of a random person in the room you would use:

  &&r->h:&&r->m

To run over to a random person in the same room and slap them in the face
you would use:

  emote runs over to &&r->n and slaps &&r->i in the face with &&c->g hand!

Note that random names are preserved. That means that the random person
chosen with &&r will stay the same throughout the entire command and that
everyone will see the _same_ random person.

As you can see, dynatext mixed with socials, room messages, login messages
etc. are a very powerful thing!

:edit_file

  message informing the newbie is trying to connect, the site they are
  coming in from, and how to let them in or not.   At this time, any
  staff member may   allow <name>   to let the newbie continue to enter
  the program as normal, or   deny <name>   to disallow access.  If a 
  newbie is denied, they will see the 'no newbies at this time' message.
  There is also a timeout period, if no staff member allows or denies

  automatically denied.
