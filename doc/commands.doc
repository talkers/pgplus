   The commands list can be found under 'commands su' and you will be able to
access this help file even if you do not have the commands as a psuedo super 
user (channel only).   (This file is huge, so dont be out in the main room
and jabbying to you friends while reading it.)

	ask     	A nice way to warn someone if you have already asked 
			someone in a tell to behave.   It shows up on their
			screen all nice and hitelled and looks official.

	assist  	Shows a clueless newbie thta you are an SU and if they 
			need help they can come to you.   (type assist me to
			what they would see)

	banish  	basically used if someone continually comes on with
			an offensive (unfortunately this occurs repeatedly
			once it starts happening a first time).

	blank		used to blank something like blank title vallie	would
			blank vallie's title.	Used if someone has something
			offensive in their title, prefix, plan, etc and they
			will not change it when you ask them.

	blankpass	used if a newbie comes on and says that they are
			already a resident and they tell you they forgot their
			password.   Usually its better to pass this onto an
			Admin if they are on because they can check to see
			if the email is valid etc etc.

        calc_spods      forces the talker to recalculate the spodlist.
                        This is only really necessary if someone wants it
                        updated. If this is used too often suggest to the
                        coder that he/she increased the automatic update
                        time.

	ckban		used to search the currently bannes sites file to see
			if a particular site is banned. uses IP addresses
			ckban 137 would look for all currently banned addresses
			that have 137 anywhere in them.
			
	comfy		go to the ever coveted comfy room.   Used for general
			SU and/or Admin discussions.

	confirm		tells you whether or not a newly ressied plater has
			filled out their email and password yet.   A good
			thing to type a minute or so after ressying someone.

	decap		used when people feel the need to continually type

			key turned on once this is acceptable, but repeated
			usage calls for this lil device.
		
	dibbs		used when you want to call 'dibbs' on a player thats a

	drag		drags someone off the program for being a repeated git.

	dumb		makes a harassing person sound like a complete baby
			(literally) and their communication is tempered until
			undumb them :)

	extend		makes someone's list longer by five units to a maximum

			to extend someone's list and create lots of red tape.
			For more than 40, an admin must extend the list.

	forcehelp	used to make a player see a certain help file
			forcehelp <player name> <help file>.    Good to show
			a player help 'rules' when theyre being idiots.

	warn		is hilighted and beeps and bascially shows a player
			That you're not screwing around with them. It is 
			logged to the program.

	xref		The coolest command we have ;) It lets you search the

			matches.   Great for checking to see if a newbie's
			name is too close to someone that's alreayd resident 
			if the newbie asks for residency.

	yoyo		spams the offender's screen and shows them a nasty 
			message to behave or else.  basically a humiliate
			tactic.

			who residented them, etcetera etcetera.

        zdel            deletes a currently being used zchannel if the
                        subject is against the rules of the talker. A
                        reason is needed and this is logged and told to
                        the people on the channel.

    These are just general comments and watching SU's use them in different
situations is the best way to learn.
